# Practice

There are a few developers applying for a job. This is a place where they are sending applications.

But looks like something went wrong with the system and company internal use salary calculator is exposed to the public.

Use your knowledge about the access modifiers and fix the code inside the developers package to expose only the needed information.

Expected output:

```
John could make 700
Alice could make 2700
Bob could make 2700
```
